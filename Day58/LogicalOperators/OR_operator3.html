        //a chain of OR "||"" returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found:
       alert( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)

       alert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
       alert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)

       alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)

        let lastName = "";
        let nickName = "SuperCoder";

       alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder
       //If all variables were falsy, "Anonymous" would show up.
    

       //Short-Circuit evaluation:
        true || alert("not printed");
        false || alert("printed");
      //In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing true, so the alert isnâ€™t run.
