<!--Task159: The Switch Statement in JavaScript
    Q2-Rewrite "if" into "switch"
    Rewrite the code below using a single switch statement:
    let a = +prompt('a?', '');
    if (a == 0) {
    alert( 0 );
    }
    if (a == 1) {
    alert( 1 );
    }

    if (a == 2 || a == 3) {
    alert( '2,3' );
    }-->

     //The first two checks turn into two case. The third check is split into two cases:
    let a = +prompt('a?', '');

    switch (a) {
    case 0:
        alert( 0 );
    break;

    case 1:
        alert( 1 );
    break;

    case 2:
    case 3:
        alert( '2,3' );
    break;
}

    /*Please note: the break at the bottom is not required. But we put it to make the code future-proof.
    In the future, there is a chance that we’d want to add one more case, for example case 4. And if we 
    forget to add a break before it, at the end of case 3, there will be an error. So that’s a kind of 
    self-insurance.*/
