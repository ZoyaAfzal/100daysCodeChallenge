        //Comparison with ||
        //For example, we could replace ?? with || and still get the same result:
            let firstName = null;
            let lastName = null;
            let nickName = "Supercoder";

      // shows the first truthy value:
         alert(firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
    
         //|| returns the first truthy value.
         //?? returns the first defined value.
            let height = 0;

           alert(height || 100); // 100
           alert(height ?? 100); // 0

        /*The height || 100 checks height for being a falsy value, and it’s 0, falsy indeed.
        so the result of || is the second argument, 100.
        The height ?? 100 checks height for being null/undefined, and it’s not,
        so the result is height “as is”, that is 0.*/
