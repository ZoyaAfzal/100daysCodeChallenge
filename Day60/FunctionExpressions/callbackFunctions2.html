        //Callback Functions :
        //We can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function :

        function ask(question, yes, no) {
        if (confirm(question)) yes()
        else no();
        }

        ask(
        "Do you agree?",
        function() { alert("You agreed."); },
        function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
        );

      //Here, functions are declared right inside the ask(...) call. They have no name, and so are called anonymous. 
      //Such functions are not accessible outside of ask (because they are not assigned to variables)
