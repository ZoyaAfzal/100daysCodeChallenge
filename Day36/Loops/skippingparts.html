        //Skipping parts in forloop:
        //For example, we can omit begin if we donâ€™t need to do anything at the loop start.
        let i = 0; // we have i already declared and assigned
        for (; i < 3; i++) { // no need for "begin"
        alert( i ); // 0, 1, 2
        }
        
        //We can also remove the step part:
        let j = 0;

        for (; j < 3;) {
        alert( j++ );
        }
       //This makes the loop identical to while (i < 3).

       //We can actually remove everything, creating an infinite loop:
        for (;;) {
        // repeats without limits
        }
        //Please note that the two for semicolons ; must be present. Otherwise, there would be a syntax error.
