//Question 31: No Users: Ensure your user list isnâ€™t empty.
//Explain & TIP: Before greeting users, check if there are any. This teaches you to handle empty arrays.
let usernames = [];
if (usernames.length === 0) {
    console.log("We need to find some users!");
}
else {
    // Greet users
}
export {};
// Removing all usernames ensures the message "We need to find some users!" is printed.
