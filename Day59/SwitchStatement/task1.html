<!--Task159: The Switch Statement in JavaScript
    Q1-Rewrite the "switch" into an "if"
    Write the code using if..else which would correspond to the following switch:
    switch (browser) {
    case 'Edge':
    alert( "You've got the Edge!" );
    break;

    case 'Chrome':
    case 'Firefox':
    case 'Safari':
    case 'Opera':
    alert( 'Okay we support these browsers too' );
    break;

    default:
    alert( 'We hope that this page looks ok!' );-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <script>
     //To precisely match the functionality of switch, the if must use a strict comparison '==='.
     //For given strings though, a simple '==' works too.

    if(browser == 'Edge') {
        alert("You've got the Edge!");
    } else if (browser == 'Chrome'
    || browser == 'Firefox'
    || browser == 'Safari'
    || browser == 'Opera') {
    alert( 'Okay we support these browsers too' );
    } else {
    alert( 'We hope that this page looks ok!' );
    }
    /*Please note: the construct browser == 'Chrome' || browser == 'Firefox' â€¦ is split into multiple lines
    for better readability.
    But the switch construct is still cleaner and more descriptive.*/
