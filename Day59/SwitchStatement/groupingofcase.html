<!--Task159: The Switch Statement in JavaScript/ Grouping of "case"-->

     //Grouping of “case”
     //Several variants of case which share the same code can be grouped.
     //For example, if we want the same code to run for case 3 and case 5:
        let a = 3;

        switch (a) {
    case 4:
        alert('Right!');
    break;

    case 3: // (*) grouped two cases
    case 5:
        alert('Wrong!');
        alert("Why don't you take a math class?");
    break;

    default:
    alert('The result is strange. Really.');
}

   //Now both 3 and 5 show the same message.
    /*The ability to “group” cases is a side effect of how switch/case works without break. Here the execution 
    of case 3 starts from the line (*) and goes through case 5, because there’s no break.*/
