      alert( null == undefined ); // true
    
      //Let’s compare null with a zero:
      alert( null > 0 );  //  false

    /*Mathematically, that’s strange. The last result states that "null is greater than or equal to zero", 
    so in one of the comparisons above it must be true, but they are both false.
    The reason is that an equality check == and comparisons > < >= <= work differently. 
    Comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0. That’s why null >= 0 is true and null > 0 is false.*/
