<!--Task159: Q6-Repeat until the input is correct
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – 
ask them to input again.
The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the 
input/enters an empty line.
Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling 
for a non-numeric input in this task.

        /*The loop do..while repeats while both checks are truthy:
    The check for num <= 100 – that is, the entered value is still not greater than 100.
    The check && num is false when num is null or an empty string. Then the while loop stops too.
    P.S. If num is null then num <= 100 is true, so without the 2nd check the loop wouldn’t stop if 
    the user clicks CANCEL. Both checks are required.*/
