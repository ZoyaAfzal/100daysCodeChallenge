        function sayHi() {   // (1) create
        alert( "Hello" );
        }

        let func = sayHi;    // (2) copy

        func(); // Hello     // (3) run the copy (it works)!
        sayHi(); // Hello    //     this still works too (why wouldn't it)
        
        //Hereâ€™s what happens above in detail:

        /*The Function Declaration (1) creates the function and puts it into the variable named sayHi.
            Line (2) copies it into the variable func. Please note again: there are no parentheses after sayHi.
            If there were, then func = sayHi() would write the result of the call sayHi() into func, not the function sayHi itself.
            Now the function can be called as both sayHi() and func(). */

      //We could also have used a Function Expression to declare sayHi, in the first line:
        
        let sayHi = function() { // (1) create
        alert( "Hello" );
        };

        let funct = sayHi;
