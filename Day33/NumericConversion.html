    // Unary+ doesn't put effect on numbers
    let x = 1;
    alert( +x ); // 1

    let y = -2;
    alert( +y ); // -2

   // Converts non-numbers
    alert( +true ); // 1
    alert( +"" );   // 0
    
    //if we are getting values from HTML form fields, they are usually strings. What if we want to sum them?
    //The binary plus would add them as strings:
    let apples = "2";
    let oranges = "3";
    alert( apples + oranges ); // "23", the binary plus concatenates string

 //If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:
    let bananas = "2";
    let mangoes = "3";

  //both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
    alert( +bananas + +mangoes); // 5

  //the longer variant
  //alert( Number(bananas) + Number(mangoes) ); // 5
