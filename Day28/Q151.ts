/* Our 151 task is to read the following article: Top 10 Programming Tips For Beginners.Here, we will
explore the top 10 programming tips for beginners that can help us build a strong foundation and navigate 
the complexities of coding with confidence.



1- Practical learning is important in Programming: 

    You become habitual of syntax and gain typing speed.
    You need to think a lot to solve problems in coding so it eventually develops problem-solving skills.
    It helps in getting the logic quickly to solve the problems.
    You become aware of common programming problems.

2- Don't leave a Gap in your learning:
    
    It reduces the response time of your brain which helps in getting the logic quickly.
    Maintaiing consistency make us face new programming challenges in our daily learning. 
    It also teaches you how to think and solve more complex problems.

3- Over Anaylysis:

    Having a good command of a specific topic is good but overanalysis can make you the worst programmer and your progress will be slow. 
    You won’t be able to the target within a deadline.

4- Read The Error Message Carefully:

    Understand that errors on the screen say a lot about the issues.
    If you don’t get the solution, just search on the internet for the error message. 

5- Solve the MCQs Questions in Programming:

    Solve MCQs as much as you can.
    You can find a lot of MCQs or debugging-related questions on the internet.
    It helps in making good commands on syntax.

6- Code With Hands:

    It is highly recommended that you use pen and paper while coding.
    It will also be helpful in the future.

7- Read Other People’s Code:

    Reading codes by other people is very helpful.
    Reading new things allows you to find solutions to problems faster.

8- Enhance Your Problem-Solving Skills:

    It is very essential that you work on your problem-solving skills.  
    Enhance your problem-solving skills by working constantly.

9- Divide Things into Smaller Parts:

    You have to take time in order to complete the work properly (that is without mistakes).
    You should know how to divide your time in a way that is correct and gets completed on time.

    For beginners, finding a mentor would be perfect as they will be guided properly from the start.
    The mentor should be an actual who should have proper knowledge about the things that you want to learn.

Conclusion:

    Remember that learning the first programming language always requires special effort. 
    Programming also needs a lot of patience and practice. 
    We need to have the patience to solve the questions.
    Start with smaller problems and train your brain to solve simple problems.  


    I am sticking to the this challenge and staying dedicated. I'm determined to finish this task as part of my 
    commitment to the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge. I want to keep challenging adopting all tips to be a best programmer. */
