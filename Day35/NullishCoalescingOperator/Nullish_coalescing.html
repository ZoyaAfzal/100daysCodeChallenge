    //The common use case for ?? is to provide a default value.
    //For example, here we show user if its value isn’t null/undefined, otherwise Anonymous:
        let user;

        alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous (user is undefined)
    
    //Here’s the example with user assigned to a name:
        user = "John";

        alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // John (user is not null/undefined)
        
    /*We’d like to display the user name using one of these variables, or show “Anonymous” if all of them 
    are null/undefined.Let’s use the ?? operator for that:*/

        let firstName = null;
        let lastName = null;
        let nickName = "Supercoder";

    // shows the first defined value:
       alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
