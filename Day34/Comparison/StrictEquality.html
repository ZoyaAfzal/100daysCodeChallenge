    //Strict Equality cannot differentiate 0 from false:
    alert( 0 == false ); // true
        
    //The same thing happens with an empty string
    alert( '' == false ); // true
        
    //In other words, if a and b are of different types, then a === b immediately returns false without an attempt to convert them.
    alert( 0 === false ); // false, because the types are different
